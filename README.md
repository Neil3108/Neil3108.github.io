### Prerequisites
You do need a resume already formated in Markdown and have a Github account. You can [visit](https://github.com/) to make a Github account.
### Markdown
Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax. You can learn the basic syntax for Markdown [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). There are number of Markdown editor avaiable and they come in many different syntax. We will fouces on Github Markdown.
As mentioned in the Andrew Etter's book Mordern Technical Writing because of the popularity of Markdown many specialized text editors exist for it. For example: <br />
    - [MarkdownPad(Windows)](http://www.markdownpad.com/)<br />
    - [iA Writer(macOS)](https://ia.net/writer)<br />
    - [ReText(Linux)](https://sourceforge.net/directory/development/wordprocessors/os:windows/)<br />
There also are many online Markdown editors. The popular ones are:<br />
    - [dillinger.io](https://dillinger.io/)<br />
    - [stackedit.io](https://stackedit.io/)<br />

## Hosting the Resume
Once you have a Github account and a resume formatted in Markdown you can host it on Github. Log into your Github account and the homepage of your account will open which will look this:

Now we just have to make a new repository and add your resume to the repository.
#### **1. Making a new Repository**
1. In the upper-right corner of the page, click **New** to creat a new repository

2. Once you are in the creat new repositorie page, it will ask you to name the repositorie. Since we want to host our resume, we will name the repositorie as `YourUserName.github.io`. For example, if your user name is XYZ you should name your repositorie `XYZ.github.io`. You can also put a little description of your repository but that is optional.

3. Now you need to decide if you want to make your repository public or private. Since this is repository will contain your resume it would be better if you make it private. *Note: If you want to make a repository private you need Github pro.*

4. Finally, we initialize files that you want with the repository. This is optional but since we are making a resume we do not need any additional files.
